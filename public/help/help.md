### Introduction

(REST, SOAP,...). You can define basic parameters of mocked up HTTP endpoint like
HTTP method, HTTP response code, URL path, MIME type of response and response.

### Usage

Application is being controlled by buttons on the main screen. There are **+ New**, **Download**, **?** buttons and **filter field**.
